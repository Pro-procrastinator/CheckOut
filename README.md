# CheckOut

A Windows form based desktop application for Point-of-sale to manage stocks and all inventories. Developed using .NET(C#) and MS-SQL server as semester project for Object-oriented Programming. 

### Abstract

With the zeal to develop something closed to real-world, we come up with this idea to make a complete GUI-based desktop application with all CRUD operations. 

CheckOut is a Point of Sale (POS) solution that will solve all of your sales and inventory issues. Users, suppliers, product categories, and goods can all be added. You can buy from your suppliers and set up auto pricing by specifying a profit and discount percentage.Later on, you can sell things with barcodes, and the system will issue a sales receipt for the customer. It will also manage stocks and keep track of sales.
